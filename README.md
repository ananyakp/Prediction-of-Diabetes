# Diabetes Prediction
The healthcare sector has swiftly grown to be particularly interested in the idea of machine learning. Medical data sets used in research predictions and analyses aid with appropriate treatment and precautions in illness prevention. the kinds of algorithms that can aid in decision-making and prediction in machine learning. We also talk about how machine learning is being used in the medical industry, with a particular emphasis on predicting diabetes.

One of the diseases that is spreading fastest in the world is diabetes, which needs to be monitored constantly. We investigate various machine learning techniques that will aid in the early diagnosis of this disease to verify this. This work explores several facets of machine learning and the different kinds of algorithms that can aid in prediction and decision-making. The scientific community's forecasts and analyses of medical datasets help the public take the necessary care and safeguards to stay healthy.

Healthcare industries have large volume databases. Using big data analytics one can study huge datasets and find hidden information, hidden patterns to discover knowledge from the data and predict outcomes accordingly.
